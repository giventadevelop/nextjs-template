# Technical Architecture

System Components:
1. Frontend
   - Next.js application
   - shadcn-ui component library
   - Responsive layouts
   - Client-side state management

2. Backend
   - Next.js API routes
   - Supabase database
   - Clerk authentication
   - RESTful API design

Data Models:

1. User (Managed by Clerk)
   - id: string
   - email: string
   - name: string
   - created_at: timestamp

2. Task
   - id: uuid
   - user_id: string (foreign key)
   - title: string
   - description: text
   - status: enum
   - priority: enum
   - due_date: timestamp
   - created_at: timestamp
   - updated_at: timestamp

APIs and Integrations:
1. Authentication API (Clerk)
   - /api/auth/*

2. Task API
   - GET /api/tasks
   - POST /api/tasks
   - GET /api/tasks/:id
   - PUT /api/tasks/:id
   - DELETE /api/tasks/:id

3. User API
   - GET /api/profile
   - PUT /api/profile

Infrastructure:
- Supabase for database
- Clerk for authentication
- Vercel for deployment

# Development Roadmap

Phase 1: MVP
- Basic authentication (sign up, login)
- Core task CRUD operations
- Simple task list view
- Basic user profile

Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Task filtering and sorting
- Priority levels
- Due dates
- Status tracking
- Enhanced UI components

Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Task categories/tags
- Search functionality
- Task analytics
- Mobile optimization
- Performance improvements

# Logical Dependency Chain

Foundation (Must be built first):
1. Authentication system setup
2. Database schema implementation
3. Basic API endpoints
4. Core UI components

Progressive Enhancement:
1. Task list view with basic CRUD
2. User profile management
3. Task organization features
4. Advanced filtering and sorting
5. Analytics and reporting

# Risks and Mitigations

Technical Challenges:
1. Risk: Real-time updates for task status
   Mitigation: Implement optimistic updates with proper error handling

2. Risk: Mobile responsiveness
   Mitigation: Mobile-first design approach using shadcn-ui

3. Risk: Performance with large task lists
   Mitigation: Implement pagination and lazy loading

MVP Considerations:
1. Risk: Feature creep
   Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP feature set

2. Risk: UI complexity
   Mitigation: Start with essential components, progressive enhancement

Resource Constraints:
1. Risk: Development time
   Mitigation: Leverage existing components and libraries

2. Risk: Technical debt
   Mitigation: Clean architecture and code reviews
